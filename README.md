# Autonomous Differential Drive Robot Computer Vision

The project tracks a virtual robot, a virtual enemy robot, one to two obstacles by label imagine and tracking centroids of the colored markers. Based on the position of the markers ,control input are calculated to execute and attack or defend strategy against the opponent robot to shoot/avoid the opponent in the shooting range.
